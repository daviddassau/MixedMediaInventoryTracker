# Stuffy Librarian

Stuffy Librarian is my final capstone project I completed for the Nashville Software School. It's original name, Mixed Media Inventory Tracker, was much more descriptive of what the application does, but the name was a tad "boring".

## What It Does
Stuffy Librarian is an application to help you log and keep track of your personal media items, including books, movies, and music. Here are some of the main features:
- View all of the media items currently in your inventory.
- Add a new item
  - Your choices are Vinyl, Cassette, CD, VHS, DVD, Blu-ray, 4K, Digital Copy, Book, and eBook.
  - When adding a new item, you can search for the media's title, and you can store the cover art. Other form fields include `Condition`, `Date Purchased (not required)`, and any notes you would like to make on that item.
